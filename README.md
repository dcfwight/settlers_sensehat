# SenseHat Catan dice roller
## Settlers of Catan dice roller using Python SenseHat

[Settlers of Catan](https://www.catan.com/) is a popular strategy board game  
[SenseHat](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat) is a RaspberryPi module with lots of sensors - e.g. it can detect shaking, useful for this particular project. 

* The average game of Catan involves 80 dice rolls.
* Ths project evens out the element of chance by simulating using a deck of cards with the 
dice rolls instead of actual dice.
* If the average game is 80 dice rolls, then this is equivalent to
just more than 2 'decks' of dice rolls, each deck consisting of
the 36 potential dice rolls you can get.


The project uses the Sense Hat as input for next turn, reporting and some animation.
