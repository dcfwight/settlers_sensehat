Settlers of Catan dice roller using Python SenseHat

The average game of Catan involves 80 dice rolls.
Evens out the element of chance by using a deck of cards with the 
dice rolls instead of actual dice.
If the average game is 80 dice rolls, then this is equivalent to
just more than 2 'decks' of dice rolls, each deck consisting of
the 36 potential dice rolls you can get.


Uses the Sense Hat as input for next turn, reporting and some animation.
